# Verification, replication, and extension of Balcetis & Dunning (2010) Study 3b pretest

"analyses.Rmd" and "alt analyses - may not currently run.Rmd" are from a previous project on versions of cohen's d for within-subject data. They borrow from Jake Westfall's now-deactivated blog, and add other versions and add notations and R implementations. The data currently in the repo is from Sabrina's PhD, it just serves as a useful within subject dataset. This would be swapped out for the chocolate-poop preference data when we have it.



## TODO

- integrate the two analysis files, choose versions of d for this project. My recollection is that the best version of Cohen's d, Cohen's d_av, is not on CRAN and seems to not often be used, which is a shame.
