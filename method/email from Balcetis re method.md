- They saw the real objects for pre-test ratings. 
- Attaching a screenshot of the survey items.
- Participants in the pretest and the real study saw the real objects used. The chocolates were, as described, Lindt chocolates in a clear bowl. The poop was a gag, novelty item. Rubber, extremely real looking. I put it in a clear ziplock bag and squirted in chocolate syrup to produce a “smudge.” They didn’t get to touch either of the items (so they didn’t know the poop wasn’t as soft as one might think it should be). We told them we collected the sample that morning. 
- On calculating Cohen’s d. I know participants saw both items and rated both items, so the pre-test DVs are within-subject and cohen’s d should reflect the within-subject nature of that outcome (which I see the publication doesn’t make clear in reporting cohen’s d but does report that the t-test is a paired samples t-test further supporting that the DVs were within-subject). I can’t find any code to confirm how we ran Cohen’s d (we’re much better now about archiving and posting our scripts, but not back then).
